News Article Classification Using LLMs
About the Project
This project is about classifying news articles into categories using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). We’ve used large language models (LLMs) to extract meaningful features from text and trained a classifier on top of those features to make accurate predictions. The aim is to automate news article categorization efficiently and effectively.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The text data is cleaned and prepared to ensure it’s ready for model training.
Transformer-Based Features: Uses advanced language models (like BERT or GPT) to capture the meaning of the text.
Classifier Training: Trains a model to predict categories using these features.
Customizable: Easy to extend for different datasets or classification problems.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-article-classification
cd news-article-classification
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you're using Google Colab, mount your Google Drive to access data files:

python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
How to Use
Prepare the Data:

Place your dataset in the data/ folder.
Use the preprocessing steps in the notebook or scripts to clean and prepare your data.
Train the Model:

Open the notebook News Article Classification LLM.ipynb and follow the steps.
Or use the command line to run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/train.py
Make Predictions:

Once the model is trained, you can classify new articles using:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/classify.py --input new_articles.json
Dataset
You’ll need a dataset of news articles for this project. Make sure it has:

Text: The content of the news articles.
Category: The labels/categories for each article.
Place the dataset in the data/ folder before running the scripts or notebook.

Models Used
Transformer Models: These models (like BERT or GPT) extract rich textual features from the news articles.
Classifier: A lightweight machine learning model is trained on top of these features to make predictions.
Results
Here’s how well the model performed on our test dataset:

Accuracy: XX%
F1 Score: XX%
Precision: XX%
Recall: XX%
Feel free to replace these with your own results after training.
