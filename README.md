News Article Classification Using LLMs
Overview
This project is about categorizing news articles into predefined categories using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and large language models (LLMs). The main steps include loading and preprocessing the data, extracting features using transformers like BERT, and training a classifier to make accurate predictions.

Features
Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the text data for analysis and training.
Transformer Models: Uses advanced language models like BERT or GPT to understand and extract meaningful features from the text.
Category Prediction: Trains a classifier to accurately predict the category of new articles.
Getting Started
Install Required Libraries
Make sure to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn transformers
Mount Google Drive (If using Colab)
If you're using Google Colab, you can mount your Google Drive to access datasets:

python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
How to Use
Prepare the Dataset:

Load the dataset into the project directory.
Ensure the dataset has columns for the article text and its category.
Run the Notebook:

Open the provided Jupyter notebook.
Follow the steps for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
Evaluate the Model:

Check performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
Use the trained model to classify new articles.
